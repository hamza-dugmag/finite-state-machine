# Finite State Machine

This project is a finite-state machine (FSM) framework for the UTAT Liquid Rocket Flight System.
Testing code is a simple LED switcher.

## Description

An FSM is an interconnected collection of different states that the rocket may be in. Each state
is associated with performing a specific task and transitioning to the next state based on input data.
